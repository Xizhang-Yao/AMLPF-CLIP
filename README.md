# AMLPF-CLIP

**AMLPF-CLIP** is an improved CLIP-based framework for histopathological image classification (HIC) that addresses key challenges in computer-aided diagnosis by integrating adaptive multi-level prompt fusion, class-balanced resampling, and cross-architecture knowledge distillation. This repository provides code and implementation details for the approach described in our upcoming paper.

## Overview

Histopathological image classification is critical for effective cancer screening, disease grading, and treatment planning. Despite advances with deep learning models, existing methods face limitations in integrating domain-specific pathology knowledge, handling class imbalance, and managing high computational costs. Our method, **AMLPF-CLIP**, leverages:

- **Adaptive Multi-Level Prompt Fusion (AMLPF):** Dynamically integrates multi-tiered, domain-specific textual cues to enhance the semantic alignment between visual and textual modalities.
- **Class-Balanced Resampling:** Adjusts sampling weights based on class-specific accuracy to mitigate bias in imbalanced datasets.
- **Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation:** Transfers predictive knowledge from a high-capacity ViT-based teacher model to a lightweight CLIP-based student model using L2 normâ€“based alignment, thereby preserving high performance while reducing computational cost.
